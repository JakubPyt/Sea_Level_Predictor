# Sea_Level_Predictor

This project was created as part of the course on the free Code Camp website:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/sea-level-predictor

In this project, I have to analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. I have to use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.

Open project in Google Colab:
